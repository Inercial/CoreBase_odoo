# Odoo Module Template
This repository contains the minimum requirements to create an Odoo module. If you're new to Odoo development or want to create a new module from scratch, this template can serve as a starting point for your project.

## Getting Started
To use this template, simply clone this repository and replace the placeholder values with your module's specific information. You can find these placeholders in the following files:

__manifest__.py: This file contains metadata about your module, such as its name, version, dependencies, and description.
models/models.py: This file contains the definition of your module's data models.

Once you've customized these files to suit your needs, you can install your module in Odoo using the Apps menu.
